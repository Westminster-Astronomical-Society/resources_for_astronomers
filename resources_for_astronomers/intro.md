In recent years the natural sciences, and in particular astronomy and
astrophysics, are increasingly open access. This means that most astronomical
research is freely available not only to professional researchers and those
affiliated with academic institutions but to the public in general. This
includes pre-print and published research as well as most observational data and
the software used to process them.

This unprecedented store of data and information makes discovering new objects
and planning observations easier than ever before. There is no longer any need
for the amateur astronomer to build databases and spreadsheets for observing
lists, that has been done for you.

The enormous volume of information available can be somewhat overwhelming
though. This guide is a general overview of what is available and how you can
access it.
