# The CDS Portal

You can start your search for astronomical objects by going to the CDS Portal
[(http://cdsportal.u-strasbg.fr)](http://cdsportal.u-strasbg.fr). Here you can
search for an object by name or position. The Sesame name resolver is used for
search by name. Coordinates can be entered in HMS format (17 57 48 +04 41 36) or
decimal degrees (269.4500 +4.6933).

Extragalactic Database (NED) if available, HiPS images and an Aladin Lite
