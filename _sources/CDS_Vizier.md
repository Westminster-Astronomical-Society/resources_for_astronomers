# CDS Vizier

VizieR is a large library of published astronomical catalogs, tables and
astronomical data. VizieR contains 24446 catalogs and an enormous amount of
data. The CDS portal or SIMBAD is usually a better place to start your search.
VizieR is better suited if you have some idea what you are looking for.

You can search across all of VizieR catalogs by position or object ID or search
for specific catalogs by name or keyword.

VizieR catalog search
```

Your query will return a list of catalogs matching the title or keyword or that
contain the object or coordinates you searched for. Object ID or coordinate
searches will usually return a large number of catalogs. The advanced search
page is better for narrowing down such a search.

Select the VizieR button to go to the query page for the catalog you desire.

You can query the catalog by object ID or position as well as using any of the
fields in the table as a constraint.
